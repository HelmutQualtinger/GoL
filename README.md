A Colorful  Interactive Tool for Exploring Conway's universes

A Simple python tool using Tkinter allowing you to create
Cellular Universes, single step through their evolution or
having them evolve by themselves. You will have to have python 
installed on your device.

The displayed colors correspond to the temperature
as defined by the number of alive neighbours 
of each cell.

You can change the generation rules determining
which cells survive and which cells get to life 
as a function of neighbours.

You can save and load "universes" to your 
local storage.

While you have a limited view of universe in the
Screen, the universe off screen is unlimited in size.
